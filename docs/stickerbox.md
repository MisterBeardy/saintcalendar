# Sticker Box Page Implementation Plan

## 1. Feature Overview

The Sticker Box page is a new feature designed to display collectible-style stickers representing saints and their associated historical events. Users can browse stickers like baseball cards, with each sticker showing an image, saint name, and historical event. Clicking on a sticker reveals detailed information about the saint and event, including dropdown options to view data from other years for the same saint.

This feature leverages existing Google Sheets data integration, database models, and API endpoints to provide an engaging, interactive experience for users interested in saint-related historical milestones.

## 2. Requirements Breakdown

### Core Functionality
- **Sticker Display**: Render stickers in a card-based layout similar to baseball cards
- **Sticker Content**: Each sticker must include:
  - Sticker image (from database or default placeholder)
  - Saint name
  - Associated historical event
- **Interactive Details**: Click-to-expand functionality showing:
  - Detailed saint biography
  - Historical event description
  - Event date and location
- **Year Navigation**: Dropdown selectors to view the same saint's data from different years (e.g., 2020, 2021, 2022)

### Data Sources
- Primary data from Google Sheets (Historical Data and Milestone Data tabs)
- Sticker references linked to saints and locations
- Database relationships: Sticker → Saint → Location

### User Experience
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Smooth transitions for sticker interactions
- Loading states during data fetching
- Error handling for missing data

## 3. Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Google Sheets → Import Process → Database → API Endpoints → Frontend Components
```

### Key Components
- **Database Models**: Utilize existing Sticker, Saint, and Location models with established relationships
- **API Layer**: Extend `/api/stickers` endpoint to support year-based filtering and detailed saint/event information
- **Frontend**: New sticker box page component integrating with existing gallery infrastructure
- **State Management**: Client-side state for selected stickers, year filters, and modal displays

### Component Hierarchy
```
app/stickers/box/page.tsx (New page component)
├── components/stickers/sticker-box-section.tsx (Main container)
├── components/stickers/sticker-card.tsx (Individual sticker display)
├── components/stickers/sticker-detail-modal.tsx (Expanded details)
└── components/stickers/year-selector.tsx (Dropdown for year navigation)
```

## 4. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- Create new page route: `app/stickers/box/page.tsx`
- Set up basic component structure
- Integrate with existing sticker API endpoints
- Implement basic sticker grid layout

### Phase 2: Sticker Display and Interaction
- Develop sticker card component with image, name, and event
- Add click handlers for detail modal
- Implement modal with saint and event information
- Style cards to resemble collectible stickers

### Phase 3: Year Navigation
- Add year dropdown component
- Modify API to support year-based queries
- Implement state management for year selection
- Update UI to reflect selected year data

### Phase 4: Polish and Optimization
- Add responsive design and animations
- Implement loading states and error handling
- Optimize image loading and caching
- Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

## 5. Dependencies and Integrations

### Existing Infrastructure
- **Database**: Sticker, Saint, Location models in Prisma schema
- **API**: `/api/stickers` and `/api/stickers/pending` endpoints
- **Frontend**: Gallery components (`client-gallery.tsx`, gallery page)
- **Data Import**: Google Sheets integration for historical and milestone data

### External Dependencies
- Next.js for routing and SSR
- React for component development
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Prisma for database operations

### Integration Points
- Extend existing sticker API to include year filtering
- Reuse authentication middleware if needed
- Integrate with existing error tracking and logging systems

## 6. Potential Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Data Consistency Across Years
**Solution**: Implement robust data validation during import process and add database constraints to ensure sticker-saint relationships remain intact.

### Challenge: Image Loading Performance
**Solution**: Implement lazy loading, image optimization, and CDN integration for sticker images. Use placeholder images for missing assets.

### Challenge: Complex State Management
**Solution**: Use React Context or Zustand for managing selected stickers, year filters, and modal states. Keep state localized to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### Challenge: API Response Times
**Solution**: Add database indexing on frequently queried fields (saint_id, year). Implement caching layers for repeated requests.

### Challenge: Mobile Responsiveness
**Solution**: Use CSS Grid and Flexbox with breakpoint-specific layouts. Test extensively on various device sizes.

## 7. Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test individual components (sticker cards, modals, selectors)
- Mock API responses for isolated testing
- Validate prop passing and state updates

### Integration Testing
- Test API integration with database queries
- Verify data flow from Google Sheets to frontend display
- Test year filtering functionality end-to-end

### User Acceptance Testing
- Test sticker display accuracy against sample data
- Validate click interactions and modal content
- Test year navigation with multi-year saint data
- Performance testing on various devices and network conditions

### Accessibility Testing
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast validation
- Focus management in modals

### Browser Compatibility
- Test across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Mobile browser testing (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Responsive design validation
